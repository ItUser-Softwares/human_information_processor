## Overview

The **Human Information Processor System (HIPS)** is an educational and interactive tool that demonstrates the structure and function of the human brain. Users can explore how specific brain regions correspond to different memory systems, cognitive functions, and motor processes. This system is designed for **students, educators, researchers, and neuroscience enthusiasts**.

---

## Features

- Interactive visualization of the **main brain regions**: Frontal, Parietal, Temporal, Occipital lobes, Cerebellum, and Brainstem/Perceptual system.  
- Mapping of **cognitive functions** such as working memory, short-term memory, long-term memory, attention, and motor control to brain regions.  
- **Stylish HTML/CSS presentation** for each brain region and functional system, including lists of subcomponents and detailed descriptions.  
- Highlights the **activation of brain regions** corresponding to each cognitive function.  
- Fully modular and extendable for **future integration with visualization or animation frameworks**.

## Brain Regions & Functional Systems

### Brain Regions

1. **Frontal Lobe**
   - Command center for reasoning, decision-making, working memory, and emotional regulation.  
   - Key areas: Prefrontal Cortex, Motor Cortex, Broca’s Area.  

2. **Parietal Lobe**
   - Integrates sensory information for body awareness and spatial understanding.  
   - Key areas: Somatosensory Cortex, Spatial Mapping, Perceptual Integration.  

3. **Temporal Lobe**
   - Handles auditory processing, language comprehension, and long-term memory.  
   - Key areas: Hippocampus, Wernicke’s Area, Amygdala.  

4. **Occipital Lobe**
   - Responsible for visual perception and interpretation.  
   - Key areas: Primary Visual Cortex (V1), Visual Association Areas, Visual Attention.  

5. **Cerebellum**
   - Fine-tunes motion, balance, and procedural memory.  
   - Key areas: Motor Coordination, Procedural Memory, Predictive Control.  

6. **Perceptual / Brainstem System**
   - Gateway for sensory input, reflexes, and autonomic control.  
   - Key areas: Reticular Formation, Autonomic Control, Sensory Relay.  

### Functional Systems

- **Working Memory:** Frontal and Parietal Lobe.  
- **Short-term Memory:** Frontal and Parietal Lobe.  
- **Long-term Memory:** Temporal and Frontal Lobe.  
- **Sensory Memory:** Parietal, Occipital, and Perceptual System.  
- **Motor System:** Frontal Lobe and Cerebellum.  
- **Cognitive System:** Frontal Lobe.  
- **Attention:** Frontal Lobe, Parietal Lobe, and Perceptual System.

## Technical Details

- **Data Structure:** `REGION_INFO` JavaScript object stores all brain regions and functional systems with detailed descriptions and mappings.  
- **Frontend Styling:** Inline CSS ensures consistent look-and-feel for all regions and systems.  
- **Mappings:** Functional systems are connected to anatomical brain regions to support interactive highlighting or glow effects.  
- **Expandable:** Easy to integrate with **D3.js, Three.js, or custom HTML/CSS interactive maps**.  

---

## Usage

1. Include the `REGION_INFO` object in your project.  
2. Render the descriptions in your frontend using innerHTML or a JS framework.  
3. Use the `mapping` property to highlight the relevant brain regions when a functional system is selected.  
4. Extend with **interactive visuals**, animations, or educational quizzes.
